would means call diehard trekkie generally enjoyed franchise including quite older pc games friend recommended game quite sick fantasy mmos decided give swingstar trek online sto massive multi game typical elements present levels gear crafting pvp quests zones customization etc differs games setting however one heavily space combat oriented character much ship captain also lot forgiving games generally easier pick playthere three general classes tactical engineering science correspond roughly three ship types escorts cruisers science vessels technically use ship want abilities bonuses clearly aimed corresponding type role strengths weaknesses example tacticalescort high dps maneuverability weaker defenses fewer support skills applies space ground differences enough make worth rerolling aside captain bridge officers also classes whose abilities use present theres two playable factions federation klingon first character fed klingons start higher level pve content game moment unsurprisingly federation playersquests pretty typical rather repetitive variant destroy x enemies scan x objects sometimes include combinations chains narrative somewhat interesting also lacking voice effects unique graphics locations relatively diverse youll rarely see something make say wow almost quests done solo though also group entering space area people enables form group sometimes sometimes done automatically also special encounters similar raids youre expected large numbers participants also pvp quests rewards comparable pve ones cases theres nothing stopping wandering high level areas also adjust difficulty easy results better drops get really fast cash credits however rarely issue choose gamut gear ranging grade rarity theres auction house mail system place mmo elements eg guilds called fleets item binding base nodes presentthe game forgiving especially normal difficulty death penalty mode higher modes theres chance ship injured destroyed gives penalty use recovery item exactly devastating rate auction house takes cut deposit die respawn last save point enemies suffered damage remain damaged generally quite easy gain experience level get better gear quests give top level gear generally stay competitive common items significantly worse even rarest using epic equipment largely luxury recustomize ship character bridge officers given time appearance skills costs money essentially nothing permanent missions finished minutes along aspects noted means game great casual playersspace combat meat game similar old starfleet command series everything power levels weapon firing arcs various weapon types present nearly identical example heavy plasma torps ton damage shot en route exactly like sfc ii juggle shield facing settings use wide variety interesting abilities equip ship huge array different weapons fun use unique simply put star trek fans dream well executedon negative side ground combat currently really primitive state call clunky something understatement rather boring even higher level skills mostly involves standing shooting someone drop hitting tab also unavoidable though thankfully seems lot less common space combat theres also quite bugs need ironed content variety bit lacking really interesting thing youll see progress levels new enemies different weapons somewhat interesting generally sick seeing time youre high enough leave area youll also likely sick ship time finally get new one final note lot server downtime moment almost every day theres maintenance disconnects quite frequent cryptic clearly lot work game good also rather irritating see patch every login get kicked every nighta note collectors ed includes several uniforms decent device item ok value though bonuses cosmetic summarize sto good game casual players st fans though exactly going blow away decent gameplay matters read space combat needs bit work others short new mmos work progress worth checking would say yes though im exactly rushing buy lifetime membershipupdate jan 2011im dropping rating star following reasonsmost cool things get game bought cstore includes nearly half endgame ships available costumes pets etc mmos content like would free would fine could get items ingame currency somehow even crazy grind many cases cant prices also way high opinionthe game developing slow rate lot things promised next nothing

expansions put actual content releasing bug fixes season update charging little actual content addedthere still endgame speak little replay value anything general grind emblems buy new retrofit ships high end gear also craft latter easier often results better items like solo play content theres also little reason group anything fact group missions buggiest game saying something consider buggy solo

updated depth review 11022013 rockstar patched game address issues present issues still remainintroduction welcome grand theft auto 5 one longest running series rockstar games grand theft auto 5 brings new things table time around enough warrant full price wait price drop rent read find outstory welcome los santos aka los angles grand theft auto 5 starts youd expect like grand theft auto 4 lets say much action oriented beginning play game youll eventually meet three characters youll able switch fly whenever want first seems really interesting quickly becomes mess player story story becomes convoluted mess youre switching back forth characters never really become invested frankly happens shame previous grand theft auto games gta 3 4 pretty decent consistent storytelling grand theft auto 5 overall storyline forces play three characters order understand dont really freedom youre forced play three characters whether want order storytelling make sense really shame storytelling becomes displaced cumbersome try wrap head around feels disjointed really disbarring experience instead one solid storyline one character become deeply invested actually caring happens said character heres short list three main characters grand theft auto 5micheal de santa rich white guy rich white guy problems back story somewhat interesting play youll notice similar vibe nico bella gta 4 micheals events story interesting somewhat varied id say hes second favorite character play storytelling somewhat sopranos mixed heist moviesfranklin clinton black guy living ghetto ghetto problems back story actually interesting micheals first quickly descends mess story goes grab attention right away micheals storyline sheer amount times characters say nword literally every word youre playing storyline frankly disjarring hear constantly constantly saying n word living ghettos uneducated people send barely understandable urban dictionary text messages npc crackheads jack cars rob liquor stores steal etc frankly every stereotype youve ever heard african american community really sticks playmuch micheals storyline trevors storyline another story n word used often franklins storyline youll sick hearing 5minutes play improve storytelling whatsoever fact makes worse due overuse one wordtrevor philips crazy rocker redneck far fun character play storyline outrageous laugh loud quit times youre playing good ol crazy trevor trevors storyline indeed poke fun rednecks living trailers drug problems meth backwater attitudes etc however opposed franklins storyline overuse racially charged words plain nut house crazy great rockstar make trevor main character grand theft auto 5 ill never know personally think games storytelling fun factor would much better would focused solely crazy things trevor going next instead mixmash three separate characters placegameplay gameplay grand theft auto 5 tries something different grand theft auto 4 way light rpg experience system entails certain activity better become said activity like driving shooting swimming etc interesting take make gta realistic fact brings nothing frustration due said system example driving mechanic default feels loose vehicle feels like skating ice gain experience driving controls actually improve vehicles sounds great paper actuality makes extremely frustrating experience control literally poor level imagine beat em game racing game shooter would throw controller wall rage thinking controller defective would assume game programmed poorly would never think developers would intentionally put place system start poor controller responses driving gradually improve gain experience lunacy bestsome gameplay issues arise playing grand theft auto 5 are1 driving mechanic loose vehicle feels like skating ice see above2 camera angles driving preset 4 modes none even remotely good driving3 aimingshooting vehicle plain horrible way describe this4 90 things game window dressing want go restaurant grab food bad prop5 underwater area completely useless swimming underwater feels like youre going literally snails pace6 constant popups graphics wise things appearingdisappearing distance etc7 cover mechanic stiff feels tacked on8 constant online issues lag losing saves cars money etc fixed others notthese small fraction issues grand theft auto 5 majority professional game reviewing sites throw 1010 gta v without ever bringing issues gta v even many normal reviews overly praise franchise without bringing faults believe plenty go around fact many people review sites blindly throw 1010s huge red flag gta 5 enjoyable game yes yes issues even bring issues professional review reviews general dishonest frankly sleazy move journalistreviewers partgraphics graphics grand theft auto 5 finest graphics see generation consoles ps3 xbox 360 game look fantastic however thats honestly ends beneath layer fluff pretty graphics lies something terrible wait monster none graphic props window dressing mean areas look like go intoenter buildings reality enter example take game elder scrolls skyrim game see house distance enter house without problems near everything entered interacted grand theft auto 5 scam biggest gta world ever falls pieces enter buildings restaurants stores see cant even interact anything around example say go fast food restaurant like grand theft auto 4 roll drive thru window expect hear familiar take order gaming world instead get dead silence interaction leave feeling disappointed oh thats start folks believe go underwater ocean youll quickly find two things quickly 1 move like literal snail 2 literally point going underwater explore constantly mean constantly run props window dressing sets grand theft auto 5 sure looks pretty point open world cant interact previous grand theft auto games called progress reason rockstar itsound hey yea like crappy music constantly playing game radio stations enjoy listening overly political satire constantly saturating eardrums game radio tv movies storylines well slap silly call shirley game seriously absolute worse music grand theft auto game date two three decent songs 98 painfully bad turn radio instant get car youll also rip hair smash head wall headbutt dog crying corner political satire starts never stops torture ears mind body soul gta 5 genuine funny story moments occasionally youll find funny comments radio large political humor bad comedy im adult gamer find music satire atrocious game enjoy wide variety music comedy styles found next nothing worth grand theft auto 5s audio

lego video game franchise like james bond 007 movies even though aspects get repeated still ton fun many people havent even come close getting annoyed lego formula lego star wars iii clone wars enjoyable experience gamers tired series might want sit one aside sharper graphics new strategystyle mode theres much new check rest us think get one much lego gamesgraphics audiolego star wars iii probably looks better lego game date especially character animation lighting effects lightsaber combat looks exciting whereas previous lego star wars games kinda clunky action theres lot background action going levels epic scope runs smooth keep mind though series started make levels look less like lego blocks like realistic graphics words made legos good chunk trend seems realistic worlds legostyle characters personally im okay music good game avoids recycling john williams music 6 feature films fact find clone wars music enjoyable listen outside show game sound effects typicallystrong quality since theyre star wars universe aside greatlooking greatsounding lego gamestoryif youre looking play lego games story youre going disappointed cutscenes meant move things along rapid comedic pace im okay quick slapstick approach trying treat stories seriously always made awkward moments previous games remember earlier star wars tried make character deaths seem sad came weird dramatic one thing caution 18 levels 3 chapters based random episodes tv show feel little disjointed villains reappear 1 chapter talking lego game whatevercharactersgood news ton different jedi evil sith robots bounty hunters bizarre aliens use bad news way many different clone troopers look similar confusing different abilities guns rockets machine guns special functions throw grenades command squadrons strategystyle levels cant tell trooper without switching trying big deal story mode levels specific characters free play mode hub youre free explore choose dozens characters find secrets bit mess might learn recognize different troopers still struggle thankfully though character fun use get past learning curve troopers youll alrightlevelsthese levels arent fun less fun lego star wars game still smash stuff pick bolts buy things build weird lego contraptions advance levels infinite lives face bosses use variety characters explore combat level really annoyed cave level geonosis source light jedi lightsabers clone trooper flashlights graphicallyimpressive disorienting couple major differences lego star wars formula clone wars less emphasis spaceship combat fact spaceship sequences simple combat eventually landing ship continue foot major addition game assault levels play story mode couple levels clone wars becomes strategy game youll collect bolts build bases take enemy sounds bit weird theres actually nice depth certain enemy building destroyed certain kinds vehicles example silver building requires powerful cannon rocket whereas gold building destroyed rapidfire weapons could work way torpedo bay destroy bases energy core wipe shield generator youll send troop squadrons vehicles cant breakthrough see deep get story levels decent job teaching play unfortunately standalone assault missions time limit itd nice players could take time mode rather forced rush everything however assault good addition lego game hope someone chooses expand future video gamethe hubthe hub areas goof around find secrets choosing level thankfully game doesnt use system used lego indiana jones 2 players spend time hub actual levels however hub lego star wars iii lot complex previous lego star wars games start youll aboard republic battleship couple corridors cant access yet eventually youll find hub quite large halfdozen rooms quite large room computer access main menu pick level thats big deal things get tricky deal separatist content order get characters secret levels fly ship republic ship nearby separatist spaceship cant even play assault game mode separatists unless youre curious enough find spaceship words pretty big hub start theres whole 2nd hub waiting unlock 50 characters ships secrets maddening lego indy 2 still little overkill thankfully computer stations around hubs play missions assault mode want also use computers stations choose character youve purchased time dont fly one spaceship bring evil character good guys spaceship vice versa might explorationheavy hubs reward patiencehow compare lego gamesthis tough question fondness star wars important fondness lego games personally like games even lego indiana jones 2 think fans previous two star wars games love even theyre familiar tv show hope gamers tired lego franchise give one try see improved presentation try new assault mode im nearly tired lego franchise lucasarts travelers tales

fora lot reviews including amazoncom talked various aspects game negative points discussed easiness gameplay bulkiness controls horrible combat positives overwhelming terrific complex utterly addictive story plot depending looking either really love game really dislike itas far gameplay concerned tried playing mouse keyboard controls felt wonky console player mostly lack affinity mouse keyboard third person controlled games spend good deal time walking things walls however plugging controller complaints went away id recommend trying controller problems game seems better suited probably due fact also xbox gamethe difficulty lessened longest journey one one hand definitely valid complaint however complaint first game times puzzles seemed utterly illogical orderspecific would spend long time trying get something accomplished simply didnt exactly game wanted aspect dreamfall lessens frustrations allow enjoy story fully said puzzles lack depth longest journey adventure games general wish bit difficult took little brain power figure dothe combat bit clunky comprised block light hit strong hit rock paper scissors type gameplay ensues strong hit break block block defends light punch light punch break someone strong attack however controls bit wonky well making battles easy unintuitive also slide side forward back blocking par fighting games like dead alive want adventure gameactually calling game might stretching little dont mean bad way playing game reminds another fantastic adventure game called indigo prophecy without simon says style gameplay move place

dreamfall frequent arent long means minor nuisance completely ignored bring reviews commenting reviewers arent bringing simply mechanics though lies heart game much like longest journey story story exciting mysterious emotional time longest journey time probably one best stories seen video game dreamfall opinion blown story water people probably argue think dreamfalls story definitely bit better seems urgent time around partly fact action adventure game opposed point click game whereas longest journey instances chased couldnt die things seem bit dire urgent pacing dreamfall also excellent helps keep moving point point ragnar tornquist much better control story spins yarn fitting novel dont want talk story order allow everyone chance view virgin eyes get story across ton dialogue much like first game dreamfall allows characters talk talk lives whats going world plot playing longest journey isnt necessary per se characters show surprising ways starting beginning small caveat story yes story doesnt end much set events third game however look back longest journey would also find game doesnt end basically explains would happen second game leaves many threads open heres hoping game sells well enough merit third gameso lies crux reviews enjoyment game come want game puts gameplay story game places story gameplay choose former probably wont like game much however like enjoy latter cant recommend game higher one right normally overlook flaws gameplay issues game keeps enthralled terrific story enjoy storycentered games ton feel confident rating game five star simply never dull

anyone tragic losses betrayals warring faction interesting choice keep main character silent except interesting times throughout violent campaignand man finally talks always something thatll catch offguard especially enjoyed quip final vice kings missionbefore get openworld things find saints row ill explain mission structure unlike games completing storybased missions allows continue onto

territories unlocked naturally throughout gangs storyline youll take west side stilwater youre done rollerz win south fighting carnales raise flags downtown area conquest vice kings winning

retracing stepsif youre taken mission option restart mission beginning everything prior mission simple small touch one im personally fond think back grand theft auto san andreas remember driving several combined hours retry missions starting point also throughout game ton save points capturing enemy stronghold crib spawn another save point location end game two dozen save points across city add ability save anywhere fly youve got easily accessible gamesaints row runs four cylinders terms presentation visuals fantastic spare genrefamiliar problems popup bad draw distance etc overall look game bright colorful giving rather comical appearance brutal game many little touches make game look smooth example characters hop seats convertible rather open doors slowly get particle effects physics engine definitely highlights though blowing cars youre treated best explosions ever seen video games dont gawk long though debris eventually come crashing crush body burn crisp manage
